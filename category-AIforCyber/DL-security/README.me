# Application of Deep Learning in Cracking Captcha Systems
This lab focuses on using deep learning to crack CAPTCHA systems, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged for both security and adversarial purposes. Students will train a deep learning model on a dataset of cracked CAPTCHAs and evaluate its ability to predict text from new, uncracked CAPTCHAs. The lab highlights the dual-use nature of AI in cybersecurity, emphasizing both its defensive and offensive applications.
