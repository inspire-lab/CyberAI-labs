# Evasion Defense with Adversarial Training 

This lab explores adversarial training as a defense mechanism to enhance CNN robustness against evasion attacks. Students will augment their dataset with adversarial examples and retrain the model, making it more resilient to perturbations. The IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox will be used to implement these techniques, demonstrating real-world defenses against adversarial manipulations.
