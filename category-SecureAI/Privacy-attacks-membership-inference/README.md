# Privacy Attacks on Machine Learning Data - Membership Inference

This lab explores membership inference attacks, a type of privacy attack, where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given data point was part of the model’s training set. Using the Nursery dataset, students will implement black-box attacks with the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART), training an attack model to infer membership status. The lab covers rule-based attacks, where correct model predictions indicate membership, and black-box attacks, where a separate classifier is trained to distinguish between training and non-training data, highlighting the privacy risks in machine learning models. ​
