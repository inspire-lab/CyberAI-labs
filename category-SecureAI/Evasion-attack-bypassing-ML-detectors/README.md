# Evasion Attacks â€“ Bypassing Machine Learning Detectors

This lab focuses on evasion attacks against machine learning-based detection systems, demonstrating how adversarial examples can be crafted to bypass classifiers. Students will build a detector to distinguish between handwritten digits (0 and 1) from the MNIST dataset and then generate adversarial examples to fool it. The lab explores real-world evasion techniques relevant to spam detection, fraud detection, and malware classification, highlighting how attackers manipulate inputs to avoid being flagged while maintaining visual or structural similarity to legitimate data.
