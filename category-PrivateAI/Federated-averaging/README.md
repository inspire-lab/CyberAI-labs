# Federated Learning â€“ Implementing Federated Averaging

This lab focuses on Federated Learning (FL) using TensorFlow Federated (TFF), where multiple clients collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. Students will implement Federated Averaging (FedAvg) from scratch, working with a non-IID partitioned MNIST dataset across multiple simulated users. The lab demonstrates the key principles of FL, including data decentralization, communication efficiency, and the challenges of training models in a federated setting.
