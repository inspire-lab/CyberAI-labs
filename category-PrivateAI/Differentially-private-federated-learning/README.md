# Differentially Private Federated Learning (DPFL)

This lab explores the integration of differential privacy (DP) with federated learning (FL) using Opacus, a PyTorch library for privacy-preserving deep learning. Students will implement federated learning with DP guarantees, ensuring that models learn from decentralized data while preserving user privacy. The lab covers privacy budget tracking, the impact of DP mechanisms on training performance, and how DP-FL can be used in privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare and finance.
