# Privacy-preserving Generative Adversarial Networks

This lab focuses on DP-GANs, which generate synthetic data while preserving privacy. Students will preprocess data, train a GAN with differential privacy constraints, and evaluate the trade-off between data utility and privacy. The lab covers privacy-preserving synthetic data generation, quality vs. privacy evaluation, and distribution analysis of generated samples, demonstrating how DP-GANs can be used in privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare and finance.
