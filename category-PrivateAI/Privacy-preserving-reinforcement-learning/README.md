# Privacy-preserving Reinforcement Learning

This lab explores differentially private Q-learning in reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to optimize decisions while preserving privacy. Using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in PyTorch, students will train an agent on the CartPole-v0 environment from OpenAI Gym, ensuring that sensitive information in the training process remains private. The lab demonstrates how differential privacy can be applied to reinforcement learning, balancing privacy and model performance in dynamic decision-making tasks.
