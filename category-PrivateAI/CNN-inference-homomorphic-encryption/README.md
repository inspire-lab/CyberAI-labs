# Privacy-Preserving CNN Inference using Homomorphic Encryption 

This lab explores privacy-preserving deep learning using homomorphic encryption (HE) to perform encrypted inference on the MNIST dataset with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Using CKKS encryption and TenSEAL, students will implement an encrypted evaluation pipeline where the input data remains encrypted throughout inference, ensuring privacy. The lab demonstrates how CNNs can be adapted for encrypted computation while considering constraints like activation functions and multiplication depth.
